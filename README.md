# SQL_Music_Store_Analysis
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the music playlist database for an online music store using SQL. By executing straightforward SQL queries, I examined the dataset to provide valuable insights. This analysis enabled the store owner to make informed decisions and support business growth by addressing key questions related to their operations.
